Recommendations

1.Targeted Awareness Campaigns:

Focus on 18–50 age groups (working adults) as they represent the highest positivity rates.
Prioritize awareness in high-risk areas (Tejgaon, Demra, Jatrabari).

2.Strengthen Testing & Monitoring:

Expand testing facilities in both developed and underdeveloped areas.
Use dashboards for real-time epidemic monitoring and early warning signals.

3.Community Engagement:

Encourage use of mosquito nets, repellents, and proper waste management.
Educate households, especially those in tin-shed and high-density housing.

4.Policy & Preventive Action:

Deploy more health workers in hotspot regions.
Implement stricter vector control in urban areas with higher case density.
